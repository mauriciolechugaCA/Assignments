                        <p>"Vitruvian Man" is a famous drawing by Leonardo da Vinci created around the year 1490. The illustration depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart inside both a square and a circle. The drawing is accompanied by notes based on the work of the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius, from which the name "Vitruvian Man" is derived.
                            The significance of the drawing lies in its exploration of the proportions of the human body and its relationship to geometry. Da Vinci sought to illustrate the ideal proportions of the human form as described by Vitruvius. The man in the drawing is positioned in such a way that his outstretched limbs touch both the circumference of the circle and the edges of the square.
                            This iconic image is not only a study of anatomy but also a representation of the harmonious relationship between the human body and geometric principles. "Vitruvian Man" has become a symbol of the intersection between art, science, and mathematics, showcasing Leonardo da Vinci's interdisciplinary approach to understanding the world.
